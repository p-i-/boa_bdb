# BoA -- Bootstrap of AGI

# Vision
A Python/LLM based agentic system capable of self-evolving under guidance from the human creator.

# Who are we?
I am π. Co-founder of https://github.com/sap-ient-ai, an open collective dedicated to AI / AGI research, development and production.

I led AutoGPT for its first 2 months [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240513162342/https://news.agpt.co/meet-the-team/). 144k GitHub stars, $12M funding. I declined to continue to lead post-funding, as I wanted to push forwards with my own vision, which is here.

# Milestones
## Done
- ✅ Preflight check: BoA is able to fully introspect and self-modify

## WiP
- 💸 Acquire preseed investment (~ $10k)
- ⚙️ Self-Recovery
- ⚙️ Self-Improvement (requires Intelligent Exploration via A* search)

## ToDo
- 💡 Ace Benchmarks
- 💰 Acquire seed investment (~ $5M)
- 💡 Train / fine-tune our own local model
- 💡 Self-governance / cryptocurrency
- 💡 BoA now acts as a universal problem solver

# Status
- After 1 year of collaborative research into AI architectures and 3 months of coding, BoA is functional
- Currently working on self-recovery, so if a self-modification breaks BoA it reloads into a recovery branch to fix the main branch.
- Currently working on A* search.
